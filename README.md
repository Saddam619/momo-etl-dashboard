## Project Description
This project is about processing **Mobile Money (MoMo) SMS data**.  
We plan to:
- Read MoMo transaction data from XML files.
- Clean and organize the data.
- Save it into a database.
- Build a dashboard to visualize transactions.

This README is for Week 1, where we focus on setting up the repository, folder structure, and planning.
